Part 1: Creating the ERD

    Start a New Model

        Open MySQL Workbench.
        Click File > New Model.
        A new tab will open. In the middle section under "Physical Schemas," double-click mydb to rename your database schema (e.g., store_db).

    Add a Diagram

        Double-click Add Diagram (icon looks like an EER diagram).
        You will see a grid canvas. This is where you draw your diagram.

    Create Tables (Entities)

        Press the Table icon (or press T) in the vertical toolbar on the left.
        Click anywhere on the grid to drop a new table.

        Double-click the new table to open the editor at the bottom.

            Table Name: Give it a name (e.g., Users).
            Columns: Click in the columns list to add fields (e.g., id, username, email).
            Datatypes: Set types like INT, VARCHAR(45), etc.
            Flags: Check PK (Primary Key), NN (Not Null), AI (Auto Increment) as needed.

    Create Relationships

        Use the Relationship Tools in the left sidebar (lines with crow's feet endings).
        1:n (One-to-Many): Click the "Non-Identifying 1:n" tool (dashed line). Click the Child table first (the "Many" side), then click the Parent table (the "One" side).
        Workbench automatically adds the foreign key column for you.

        IMPORTANT!!!! the names under "Foreign Key Name" in the "Foreign Key" section need to be different to the primary key

Part 2: Convert to Database (Forward Engineer)

Once your diagram is finished, you push it to your MySQL server.

    Connect to Database

        Go to the top menu: Database > Forward Engineer... (or press Ctrl+G / Cmd+G).

    Connection Options

        Select your stored connection (usually "Local instance 3306").

        Click Next.

    Options

        You can usually leave these settings as default. If you are overwriting an existing database, check DROP Objects Before Each CREATE Object.

        Click Next.

    Select Objects

        Make sure "Export MySQL Table Objects" is checked.

        Click Next.

    Review SQL

        Workbench generates the raw SQL code for you. You can review it here.

        Click Execute.

    Finish

        If successful, you will see a "Forward Engineer Finished Successfully" message.

        Go back to the Home tab, open your Local Connection, and check the "Schemas" tab on the left. Your new database and tables will be there, ready for data.
